Yet users are regularly bogged down by slow page loads, delayed interactivity after page load, high input latency on critical interactions (tap, click, scroll etc), and janky animations or scrolling. These negative experiences turn away users and hurt businesses.\n\nDevelopers need to measure performance in the real world to get insight into their users\u0027 experiences on the myriad configurations of devices and networks. Unfortunately, many of the techniques used today don\u0027t capture the right metrics or make performance worse.\n\nThis talk will cover the new metrics and platform APIs that enable user-centric performance measurement, both in the lab and the real world. We\u0027ll show how developers can track down problems, understand their root causes, and prevent future regressions to ensure users consistently get a great experience.","startTimestamp":"2017-05-18T21:30:00Z","endTimestamp":"2017-05-18T22:30:00Z","isFeatured":false,"isLivestream":false,"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d6Ljq-Jn-EgU\u0026list\u003dPLNYkxOF6rcICniLJ2rfj0FexlA-9zmJJE\u0026index\u003d12","livestreamChannel":"6","tags":["LEVEL_ADVANCED","THEME_PLATFORMS","TRACK_MOBILEWEB","TYPE_SESSIONS"],"mainTag":"TRACK_MOBILEWEB","color":"#FFF176","speakers":["587010d6-c860-4dbc-bc89-d04e8b391dc9","4ecb44cf-a959-47e8-9553-8daca13ee27a"],"room":"54adc1dc-ee51-44c4-a919-87aec2351826"},{"id":"4b529ec9-f823-4049-bb1d-277dc775a070","url":"https://events.google.com/io/schedule?sid\u003d4b529ec9-f823-4049-bb1d-277dc775a070","title":"Office Hours with the Android Auto team","description":"Have questions about Android Auto?
